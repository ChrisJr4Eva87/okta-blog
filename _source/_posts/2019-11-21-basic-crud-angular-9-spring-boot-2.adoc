Angular is a web framework for building mobile and desktop applications. It's first version, AngularJS, was one of the first JavaScript MVC frameworks to dominate the web landscape. Developers loved it and it rose to popularity in the early 2010s. AngularJS 1.0 was released on June 14, 2014. Angular 9 was recently released, giving Angular quite a popularity run in the land of web frameworks.

Angular 9's biggest new feature is Ivy. Ivy is Angular's new compiler and renderer. The renderer is the engine that takes your components and templates and translates them into instructions that manipulate the DOM. Ivy is an internal component, so you don't interact with it directly. However, it can have a big impact on your code, yielding much smaller JavaScript bundles and increasing performance.

Simply put: upgrading to Angular 9 will make your web apps faster!

Other noteable features in Angular 9 include:

1. Enhancements to Angular CLI to support internationalization (i18n).
2. Type-safe improvements to `TestBed` for unit testing.

To use Angular CLI's i18n feature, you simply need to add the `i18n` attribute to your text elements, then run `ng xi18n` to extract your localizable text into a file.

`TestBed.inject(Component)` is the new way to get references to components in tests. `TestBed.get(Component)` is deprecated.

Spring Boot is one of the most popular frameworks for developing Java applications and REST APIs. It also has first class support for Kotlin!

Spring Boot 1.0 was released on April 1, 2014 and revolutionized the way Java developers write Spring apps. Instead of writing a lot of boilerplate XML or JavaConfig with annotations, Spring Boot introduced the idea of pre-configured _starters_ with smart defaults.

Spring Boot 2.2 was released in September 2019 and focuses on performance improvements and reduced memory usage. It adds Java 13 support, RSocket support, and the ability to group health indicators. This can be useful if you're deploying to Kubernetes and want different groups of indicators for "liveness" and "readiness" probes.

In this post, I'll show you how to build a CRUD application with Angular 9 and Spring Boot 2.2. Along the way, I'll do my best to weave in security tips and how to make your applications more secure.

// Mention 10 Excellent Ways to Secure Spring Boot. TLS, mkcert, CSRF, dependabot, CSP, OIDC.

**Prerequisites:**

* https://nodejs.org/[Node 12]+
* https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Java 11]+
* An https://developer.okta.com/signup/[Okta Developer Account]

To install these Node and Java on a Mac, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can use https://docs.brew.sh/Installation[Homebrew].

[source,shell]
----
brew install node
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew cask install adoptopenjdk11
----

You can also use https://sdkman.io[SDKMAN!] to install Java 11.

[source,shell]
----
sdk install java 11.0.5.hs-adpt
----

You can refer to the table of contents below for the steps in this tutorial.

== Create an Angular 9 App

To create an Angular 9 app, you first need to install Angular CLI.

[source,shell]
----
npm install -g @angular/cli@9.0.0-rc.2
----

Then create a directory on your hard-drive called `angular-spring-boot`. Open a terminal window and navigate to this directory. Run `ng new` to create an Angular application.

[source,shell]
----
ng new notes --routing --style css
----

This will take a minute or two to complete, depending on your internet speed and hardware. Once it's finished, navigate into the directory and run `ng serve`.

[source,shell]
----
ng serve
----

Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200` and you'll see the default homepage.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-boot-2-angular-9/default-homepage.png' %}[alt=Angular default homepage,width=800,align=center]

Stop the `ng serve` process using kbd:[Ctrl+C] in your terminal.

== Add Angular Authentication using OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect (also called OIDC) is an identity later that's based on the OAuth 2.0 specification. It leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to provide an ID token and other features like discoverability and a `/userinfo` endpoint.

Okta has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users + roles in any application.

To add OIDC login support to your Angular 9 app, you'll first need an https://developer.okta.com/signup[free Okta developer account]. After you've created your account and logged in to your Okta dashboard, create a new OIDC app using the following steps:

1. Navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**
2. Select **Single-Page App** and click **Next**
3. Provide a name (e.g., `Angular 9`) and change the Login redirect URI to `http://localhost:4200/implicit/callback`
4. Select **Authorization Code** as a Grant type
5. Click **Done**

Your app's settings should resemble the following.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-boot-2-angular-9/angular9-oidc-settings.png' %}[alt=Angular OIDC App Settings,width=700,align=center]

At the bottom of the screen, you'll see your app's Client ID. You might also notice that **Use PKCE** is selected. This setting provides the maximum level of security you can currently have for single-page apps when using OIDC for auth.

TIP: To learn more about PKCE (pronounced "pixy"), see link:/blog/2019/08/22/okta-authjs-pkce[Implement the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE Flow].

Copy your client ID and your issuer URI (from **API** > **Authorization Servers**) into the following command.

[source,shell]
----
ng add @oktadev/schematics --issuer=$issuer --clientId=$clientId
----

This adds Okta's Angular SDK and configures OIDC authentication for your app.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-boot-2-angular-9/oktadev-schematics.png' %}[alt=OktaDev Schematics in Action,width=800,align=center]

Start your app again using `ng serve -o` and you'll see a **Login** button in the bottom left.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-boot-2-angular-9/angular-login-button.png' %}[alt=Login button,width=800,align=center]

Click on it and you'll be redirected to Okta to login.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-boot-2-angular-9/okta-login.png' %}[alt=Okta Login form,width=600,align=center]

Enter valid credentials and you'll be redirected back to your app. There will now be a **Logout** button, indicating that you've authenticated successfully.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-boot-2-angular-9/angular-logout-button.png' %}[alt=Logout button,width=800,align=center]

Now that you've created a secure Angular 9 app, let's create a Spring Boot app to serve up data with a REST API.

== Create a Spring Boot 2.2 App

The good folks at Pivotal created https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io] to help you create Spring Boot apps quickly with minimal fuss. This site is a Spring Boot app that has a REST API you can talk to with https://httpie.org/[HTTPie].

Kotlin is an intriguing language for Spring developers because it reduces boilerplate code and allows succinct, effective code. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, so you can continue to use the Java libraries and frameworks you know and love. Not only that, but Spring has first-class support for Kotlin.

Create a new Spring Boot app that uses Java 11, Kotlin, Gradle, and has the necessary dependencies to create a secure CRUD API.

[source,shell]
----
http https://start.spring.io/starter.zip javaVersion==11 language==kotlin \
 artifactId==notes-api groupId=com.okta.developer packageName==com.okta.developer.notes \
 type==gradle-project dependencies==h2,data-jpa,data-rest,okta,web -d
----

Run this command in a terminal and a `notes-api.zip` file will be downloaded. Expand it into the `angular-spring-boot/notes-api` directory.

[source,shell]
----
unzip notes-api.zip -d angular-spring-boot/notes-api
----

You can also use https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io] in your browser to create this same app.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-boot-2-angular-9/start.spring.io.png' %}[alt=Create app with start.spring.io,width=800,align=center]

=== Secure Spring Boot with Spring Security, OAuth 2.0, and OIDC

Because you selected Okta as a dependency, you'll need to create an OIDC app for it to authenticate with Okta. You could use the client ID from your Angular app, but if you ever want to allow people to login to your Spring Boot app, it'll need it's own OIDC app.

Log in to your Okta dashboard, then:

* Go to **Applications** > **Add Application**
* Select **Web** and click **Next**
* Give it a name like `Spring Boot 2.2` and change the Login redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta`
* Click **Done**

Your app's settings should look as follows.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-boot-2-angular-9/spring-boot-oidc-settings.png' %}[alt=Spring Boot OIDC Setttings,width=800,align=center]

Copy your app's OIDC settings to `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
okta.oauth2.issuer=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id={yourClientId}
okta.oauth2.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
----

TIP: You should never store secrets in source control. To prevent you from checking secrets in, you can use https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[git-secrets]. For this example, move your client secret from `application.properties` to `okta.env` and ignore `*.env` in `.gitignore`.

[source,shell]
----
export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
----

Run `source okta.env` to set these environment variables, then start your app using `./gradlew bootRun`. Open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser and you'll be redirected to Okta to sign in.

NOTE: If you don't get prompted, it's because you're already logged in. Try it in an incognito window to see the the full login flow.

=== Spring Boot as an Auth 2.0 Resource Server

Your Spring Boot API is now secure, but it's not configured to look for an `Authorization` header with an access token in it. You need to write some code to make Spring Boot API an OAuth 2.0 resource server.

Create a `SecurityConfiguration.kt` class in the same directory as `DemoApplication.kt`:

[source,kotlin]
----
package com.okta.developer.notes

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

@Configuration
class SecurityConfiguration : WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter() {
	override fun configure(http: HttpSecurity) {
		http
			.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
				.and()
			.oauth2Login()
				.and()
			.oauth2ResourceServer().jwt()
	}
}
----

INFO: The `oauth2Login()` configuration is not necessary for this example to work. It's only needed if you want to require authentication from a browser.

== Add a Notes REST API with Spring Data REST

Start by creating a new `Note` entity in `src/main/kotlin/com/okta/developer/notes/DemoApplication.kt`.

[source,kotlin]
----
package com.okta.developer.notes

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
import org.springframework.boot.runApplication
import javax.persistence.Entity
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue
import javax.persistence.Id

@SpringBootApplication
class DemoApplication

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	runApplication<DemoApplication>(*args)
}

@Entity
data class Note(@Id @GeneratedValue var id: Long? = null,
				var title: String? = null,
				var text: String? = null,
				var user: String? = null)
----

Kotlin's [data classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html) are built to hold data. By adding the `data` keyword, your class will get `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and a `copy()` function. The `Type? = null` syntax means the arguments are nullable when creating a new instance of the class.

Create a `NotesRepository` for persisting the data in your notes. Add the following lines of code just below your `Note` entity.

[source,kotlin]
----
@RepositoryRestResource
interface NotesRepository : JpaRepository<Note, Long>
----

The `extends` syntax differs from Java and is a lot more concise (a colon instead of `extends`).

Create a `DataInitializer.kt` class that populates the database with some default data on startup.

[source,kotlin]
----
package com.okta.developer.notes

import org.springframework.boot.ApplicationArguments
import org.springframework.boot.ApplicationRunner
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component

@Component
class DataInitializer(val repository: NotesRepository) : ApplicationRunner {

	@Throws(Exception::class)
	override fun run(args: ApplicationArguments) {
		listOf("Note 1", "Note 2", "Note 3").forEach {
			repository.save(Note(title = it, user = "user"))
		}
		repository.findAll().forEach { println(it) }
	}
}
----

Restart your Spring Boot app and you should see the following printed to your console on startup.

[source,shell]
----
Note(id=1, title=Note 1, text=null, user=user)
Note(id=2, title=Note 2, text=null, user=user)
Note(id=3, title=Note 3, text=null, user=user)
----

Create a `HomeController.kt` class (in the same `DemoApplication.kt` file) and use it to filter notes by the currently logged-in user.

[source,kotlin]
----
import java.security.Principal

@RestController
class HomeController(val repository: NotesRepository) {

    @GetMapping("/")
    fun home(principal: Principal): List<Note> {
        println("Fetching notes for user: ${principal.name}")
        val notes = repository.findAllByUser(principal.name)
        if (notes.isEmpty()) {
            return listOf()
        } else {
            return notes
        }
    }
}
----

The `findAllByUser()` method doesn't exist on `NotesRepository`, so you'll need to add it. Thanks to Spring Data JPA, all you need to do is add the method definition to the interface, and it will handle generating the finder method in the implementation.

[source,kotlin]
----
interface NotesRepository : JpaRepository<Note, Long> {
    fun findAllByUser(name: String): List<Note>
}
----

== Lock Down Spring Boot with Recommended Security Practices

* CSRF vs. SameSite
* CSP
* HTTPS

== Use PostgreSQL for Production with Spring Boot

To pull down an image for the latest stable release of Postgres, simply run

[source,shell]
----
docker pull postgres
----

This will pull down the latest stable release Postgres image from the official Postgres docker hub repository.

If your want to persist data generated by the Postgres instance running inside a container beyond the container's lifecycle, we need to map a local mount point as a data volume to an appropriate path inside the container. Typically I create a volumes folder (we can give the folder any name we like) in my home directory and then create subfolders for each of the applications I need to create data volume mount points for.

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres
----

Starting the Postgres container is as simple as running the docker run command

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm --name postgresql-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -d -p 5432:5432 \
  -v $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data  postgres
----

We have provided several options to the docker run command:

— rm: Automatically remove the container and it's associated file system upon exit. In general, if we are running lots of short term containers, it is good practice to to pass rm flag to the docker run command for automatic cleanup and avoid disk space issues. We can always use the v option (described below) to persist data beyond the lifecycle of a container
— name: An identifying name for the container. We can choose any name we want. Note that two existing (even if they are stopped) containers cannot have the same name. In order to re-use a name, you would either need pass the rm flag to the docker run command or explicitly remove the container by using the command docker rm [container name].
-e: Expose environment variable of name POSTGRES_PASSWORD with value docker to the container. This environment variable sets the superuser password for PostgreSQL. We can set POSTGRES_PASSWORD to anything we like. I just choose it to be docker for demonstration. There are additional environment variables you can set. These include POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_DB. POSTGRES_USER sets the superuser name. If not provided, the superuser name defaults to postgres. POSTGRES_DB sets the name of the default database to setup. If not provided, it defaults to the value of POSTGRES_USER.
-d: Launches the container in detached mode or in other words, in the background.
-p: Bind port 5432 on localhost to port 5432 within the container. This option enables applications running out side of the container to be able to connect to the Postgres server running inside the container.
-v: Mount $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres on the host machine to the container side volume path /var/lib/postgresql/data created inside the container. This ensures that postgres data persists even after the container is removed.
